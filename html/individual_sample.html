There are treadmills on the top floor that let you look down at the bottom floor so that's where I do most of my scouting. Also, the gym has female only hours so that's nice too!</td>

									<td>When I'm not too busy running the United States of America, I like to come down to McMaster University and workout in their gym. Everyone tends to run away from me when I come in and I'm guessing it's partially due to the hundreds of secret service men there that are scaring them off. Once I retire come November, I'm going to move to Canada premanently so I can workout here all the time (also to avoid trump).</td>
