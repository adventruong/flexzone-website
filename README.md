# flexzone-website
A website created for the Web Systems and Web Computing course I took (4WW3). I utilised HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and PHP to manipulate how my site looked and turned out. I used Amazon Web Services (AWS) and PHP in order to make the page dynamic. 

The purpose of this project was to create a yelp-like website without using bootstrap. I chose to make a yelp-like website for gyms. All styling and formatting had to be done through js, css and php. 

There are two folders, php and html, for both versions of the website. The PHP one will not load correctly anymore since the AWS account I was using has terminated. If you want to see how the website was suppose to look with hard coded results, check the html folder.
