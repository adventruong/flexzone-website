Note:	I chose to allow markers to display information about the location by hovering over them instead of clicking on them to allow for users to go to the individual_sample page when clicking on them instead
			I hard coded some things into the input tags such as required and pattern. That way I can display messages in the little flags that pop up when the required boxes aren't matching the patterns.
			This lets me display fewer messages on the forms (such as password and email not matching messages). 
			
			If you have anymore questions feel free to message me.
			
Note: Load More... button doesnt work on the result_sample page (aethstics)

Note: When submitting reviews and gyms, you cannot use apostrophes as it messes with the database
Note: Hours on the individual_sample pages are always the same because i didnt populate them
